    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column1">
            <p>Hello, my name is Chris Hull.  I am a working professional and a father of two daughters.  They are the greatest joys of my life.  I have an amazing partner who has three children of her own.  They have all reached young adulthood which has brought us to a point in our lives where we can do more things we 'always wanted to'.  And we are making the most of it!</p>
            <p>I am taking this course for a few reasons. Mostly for personal growth. I
                have been telling myself for many years that I would like to go back to school, and now I have finally
                taken the first step. This class is me dipping my toes back into the water so to speak.  While I have not figured out everything that I want to take or the pace I can go at,  I am excited about the opportunities in front of me.  Just logging into my own Canvas account is pretty cool, I hope I do not need to ask my children for help.</p>
            <p>In my professional life I work for a medical technology company.  I work with cloud technologies, primarily AWS and Azure.  I have experience with Microsoft's dotnet framework, primarily using c#.  While I am regularly around web developers it is not part of my daily routine.</p>
                <p>
                In my spare time I enjoy doing a variety of things, among my favorite activities are:
            <ul>
                <li>Paddleboarding</li>
                <li>Sailing</li>
                <li>Snowboarding</li>
                <li>Building Legos</li>
                <li>Running</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, I am a history buff, I really enjoy reading the stories about the people and places that lie just under the headlines.  I have always been fascinated by the British code-breakers of the second world war.  Two summers ago I made it to Bletchley Park, it was amazing to stand in the middle of a place I had read so much about and played such a pivitol role history.</p>
